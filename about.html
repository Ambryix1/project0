        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Amber Michelle Hill. I have a better website here: <a>ambermichelle.com</a>. I've beeen living in London, United Kingdom for nearly 9 years. I've recently graduated from the University Collge London with a doctorate in Biomedical Neuroscience. While I was pursuing my PhD, I founded and directed a not-for-profit social enterprise. I started to automate some of the administrative activities the organisation was doing using the knowledge that I had available to me. After I graduated, I was awarded a prestigious Enterprise Fellowship with the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry on developing the software I had started and to create a company from it. I've enrolled in the Harvard course to learn about web programming and leveraging basic techniques to create something more intricate.</p>
        <h2>Otherwise, I'm really quite boring. I do all the boring things.</h2>
